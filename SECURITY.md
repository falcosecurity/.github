## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue, email [cncf-falco-maintainers@lists.cncf.io](mailto:cncf-falco-maintainers@lists.cncf.io?subject=SECURITY) and include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line.

The **Falco** team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Note also that the team can use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-github-security-advisories) to disclose, fix, and publish information about the vulnerability you responsibly reported to us.
