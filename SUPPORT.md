Hi!  👋

We are excited that you are using **Falco** projects and we would love to help you.

## Questions

Please chat and ask questions in our [Slack channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/falco).

Jump in there and lurk, talk to us, and help others.

In case you have topics you would like to discuss we also have bi-weekly [community calls](https://github.com/falcosecurity/community)
on [Wednesdays at 8am Pacific](https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-falco-dev/calendar)
via [Zoom](https://zoom.us/my/cncffalcoproject).

### Asking quality questions

Help us help you!

Spending time framing a question and adding support links or resources makes it
much easier for us to help.

It is easy to fall into the trap of asking something too specific when you are
close to a problem.

Then, those trying to help you out have to spend a lot of time asking additional
questions to understand what you are hoping to achieve.

Spending the extra time up front can help save everyone time in the long run.

* Try to define what you need help with:
  * Is there something in particular you want to do?
  * What problem are you encountering and which steps did you take to try
    addressing it?
  * Is there a concept you are not understanding?
* Avoid falling for the [XY problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem)
* Search on GitHub and Slack to see whether a similar question was asked in the past
* If possible, provide sample code, a snippet, or a video
* The more time you put into asking your question, the better we can help you
